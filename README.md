## Hailo Packages Installation

For installation instructions, see [Hailo Raspberry Pi 5 installation guide](doc/install-raspberry-pi5.md#how-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-5-and-hailo-8l).

## Available Examples and Resources

### Hailo Dataflow Compiler (DFC) is now available
The Hailo Dataflow Compiler (DFC) is a software tool that enables developers to compile their neural networks to run on the Hailo-8/8L AI processors. 
The DFC is available for download from the [Hailo Developer Zone](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/software-downloads/) (Registration required).
For examples, tutorials, and retrain instructions, see [Hailo Model Zoo Repo](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo).
Additional documentation and [tutorials](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/documentation/dataflow-compiler/latest/?sp_referrer=tutorials/tutorials.html) can be found in the [Hailo Developer Zone Documentation](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/documentation/).
For a full end-to-end training and deployment example, see the [Retraining Example](doc/retraining-example.md).
The Detection basic pipeline example includes support for retrained models. For more information, see [Using Retrained Models](doc/basic-pipelines.md#using-retrained-models).


### Hailo Examples

#### [Basic Pipelines (Python)](doc/basic-pipelines.md#hailo-rpi5-basic-pipelines)
  These pipelines are included in this repository. They demonstrate object detection, human pose estimation, and instance segmentation in an easy-to-use format.
  For installation instructions, see [Basic Pipelines Installation Guide](doc/basic-pipelines.md#installation).
  #### NEW: Retrained networks support
  This application includes support for using retrained detection models. For more information, see [Using Retrained Models](doc/basic-pipelines.md#using-retrained-models).

#### CLIP Application - Coming Soon
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), Predict the most relevant text prompt on real-time video frames using the Hailo-8L AI processor.
### Raspberry Pi Official Examples
#### rpicam-apps
  Raspberry Pi [rpicam-apps](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#rpicam-apps) Hailo post process examples.
  This is Raspberry Pi's official example for AI post-processing using the Hailo AI processor integrated into their CPP camera framework. 
  The documentation on how to use the rpicam-apps can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-kit.html).
  To run an example from the rpicam-apps, follow the instructions below:
  Clone the rpicam-apps repository to get the JSON configuration files
  ```bash
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpicam-apps.git
  ```
  Change directory to the assets folder and run the example
  ```bash
  cd rpicam-apps/assets/
  # Run the example
  rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file hailo_yolov6_inference.json --lores-width 640 --lores-height 640
  ```
#### picamera2 - Coming Soon
  Raspberry Pi [picamera2](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2) is the libcamera-based replacement for Picamera which was a Python interface to the Raspberry Pi's legacy camera stack. Picamera2 also presents an easy to use Python API.
